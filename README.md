# Smart-House-3.0
The objective of this project was to use some of the programming knowledge learned in class and put it into practice once more to design and manufacture a model of a house, which would be instrumented with LEDs, door openers, photoresistors, a motor for a fan, and temperature sensors through an Arduino.
